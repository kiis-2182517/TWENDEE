Hi, my name's Nam
so this is the README.md file where I will so you how to get my project up and running locally.

First of all, my project is coding in Reactjs but you don't need to do anything, just need to dowload all of my project on Github and open it in coding app ( suggest in Vscode)

And in vscode, open my App.js file, click in the Terminal and type "npm start".

If it can not work, pls just contact me.
